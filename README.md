# NewGame
Small 2.5D game. Press 'H' to activate Demo/Benchmark mode.
Main purpose is to train design patterns and architecture skills, and just for fun (cause i like game dev).
Game has its own engine on pure Java without any frameworks.
Now with...thousands of battle units!
Today (01/10/15) i've got new benchmark record - 5400 units with 40 fps (AMD FX6350, GTX650Ti, 8Gb).
